                Ax Cobb applies a precise, four-point framework to ensure each placement supports both immediate
                organizational needs and long-term growth. Central to this evaluation is determining whether a candidate
                can articulate a clear vision that resonates with both staff and leadership, generating alignment and
                momentum across the institution. We also assess whether their leadership style and personality can
                energize teams, strengthen client relationships, and restore a sense of optimism within the
                organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Equally important is evaluating the immediate impact a finalist would bring: their ability to reinforce
                credibility at the helm and provide strong, stabilizing leadership from day one. Ultimately, our process
                asks a forward-looking question—whether one, two, or three years after the hire, executives across the
                organization will echo the sentiment: "Ax Cobb truly delivered on that placement."
